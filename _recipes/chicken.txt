

ingredients:

- 1 bag of frozen chicken tenderloins
- Salt
- Pepper
- Garlic powder
- Olive Oil Spray.
- 2 cookie sheets
- Tinfoil (to line the cookie sheet)
- Parchment paper (chicken won’t stick to it, easy clean up)
- Tupperware containers – or Pyrex
- Pot holders (I use these) 


directions:

- Pre-heat your oven to 350.
- Line your cookie sheets with tinfoil and parchment paper.
- Grab your bag of chicken, put the chicken on the trays. Wash your hands with soap and water before handling your spices.
- Take your olive oil spray, and spray the topside of each chicken.
- Sprinkle each side with salt, pepper, and garlic powder (OR “Everything but the Bagel” seasoning).
- Flip them over (with tongs or your hands).
- Repeat with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
- Put them in the oven for 25 minutes.
- At 13 minutes, check your chicken to make sure things are going well!
-  At 25 minutes, take your chicken out of the oven. Cut a piece in half, make sure it is uniformly white throughout. No pink gooey chicken!
