ingredients:
- 1 lb dried black beans
- 1 onion
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 tsp Cayenne pepper
- 5 cloves garlic
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 can Rotel with green chilis
- 4 teaspoons cumin
- 5 cups water
- 3 cups cooked rice

directions:
- Rinse and drain beans (no soaking required)
- Mix all ingredients (except rice) into crock pot.
- Set on high for 8 hours or low for 10-12 hours.
- Season with salt to taste. Don't add salt before cooking, otherwise it'll keep the beans from getting as soft!
- Serve over hot rice.

For leftovers, put beans in container first, then layer rice on top. This prevents beans from drying out.

The beans will be liquidy after cooking. It makes a great gravy for putting on the rice and holds a lot of the flavor (spices and tomato juice). If you want to, you can drain them, but IMO, it's better with it.
